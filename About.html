            <h2>About Us</h2>

            <p>From the start, this group has been committed to working with the premier dog handlers in the country to
                draw from their extensive experience. As Policy and Procedures, Standards and Programs are being
                developed, insight and input is being obtained from these handlers in an effort to provide the best
                canine product for NSDA members and the canine community as a whole.</p>

            <h2>About Us</h2>

            <p>NSDA believes that quality standards reflect well on an organization as well as those who are certified
                by them. Since it is recognized that NIMS will play a major roll in the future of search and rescue,
                NSDA standards will meet or exceed NIMS as programs are developed and NIMS Guidelines become known.</p>
